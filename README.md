Changes we made to the original code:

In this game you can navigate between the states in the enemy's state machine, in order to define the enemy behavior:

Press E:  The enemy will choose the furthest target from the player in his arsenal of target destinations and move towards it.

Press G: The enemy will choose the closest target from the player in his arsenal of target destinations and move towards it.

Press C: The enemy will chase the player.

Press H: The enemy will go after the engine inside the building.
